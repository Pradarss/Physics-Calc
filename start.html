    <!-- You have learnt and understood the Physics formulae of topics like – Acceleration, Ballistics, Buoyancy, Centrifugal Force, Centripetal Force, Collision, Conversion, Deceleration, Density, Displacement, Falling Object, Force, Friction, Gravity, Horsepower, Impact, Kinematics, Lever, Magnitude, Mass, Maximum Height, Momentum, Net Force, Pendulum, Projectile Motion, Pulley, Resultant Vector, Torque & Velocity – and have studied about their uses too but when it comes to solving such formulae, you find it tough and complex. Our online Physics Calculator is a simple and unique tool which can be used to solve and calculate physics terms. Physics is the only stream in Science which consists of lots of physical formulae. So, solve them with this online calculating tool absolutely for free and enjoy learning Physics. -->
